1. Change menu items to autodetect meet vs event
    - May involve changing parse order for url's?
COMPLETED

2. Make sure this works 
    - Test on a couple of meets and events
    - Add relay parsing
    - Fix if it does not work
Working for everything but relays

3. Add output formats
    - txt file?
    - String?
    - Table? 
    - Excel
    - Sheets
stdout and csv for now, can't think of what else is useful...
may be worth including or excluding diving flags

4. Sidearm stats (different url format besides last .htm)

5. Code quality check
