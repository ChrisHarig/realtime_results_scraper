## Description
A small parser in rust to get meet results from https://swimmeetresults.tech/ results pages. 

As of December 10th 2025, all realtime results url's follow the same url scheme and DOM structure, so this parser should work on any realtime results page. 

Some meets can be found on the home page: https://swimmeetresults.tech/. The link structure for a meet: https://swimmeetresults.tech/NCAA-Division-I-Men-2025/, and a specific event: https://swimmeetresults.tech/NCAA-Division-I-Men-2025/250326F001.htm. 

The parser returns the results for either a whole meet or a page in your desired format. 

## Usage

Fill in information here 
- pass in a link (either meet or event)
- default ouput is text?
- output flag
- logging flag

Thats all.
